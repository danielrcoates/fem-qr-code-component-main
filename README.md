### What I learned

I learned that I am rather rusty, and need to do a lot more reading, particularly around the newer methods within CSS, and had to rely on searching, some of the resources I used are listed bellow.

### Continued development

I want to learn a few more things, and then revisit this challenge again in the future, see if I can clean up the CSS, and improve things slightly.
